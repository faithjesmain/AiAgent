# AiAgent for Research
I built an AI Agent that utilizes the Claude LLM with the purpose of finding sources and writing a paper on any given topic. This agent can access information using Wikipedia and DuckDuckGo, provide a research paper with sources, and save to a text file. 

## How It's Made!
Python, LangChain(Anthropic), VS Code

This Ai Agent accesses Claude's API. By building a template and using a parser, given a query by the user, the agent parses and formats the information to create a research paper. I also built tools for searching the web and saving the output to a text file. This agent has the ability to search for information using Claude, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo, and provides sources from the sites it utilizes.
